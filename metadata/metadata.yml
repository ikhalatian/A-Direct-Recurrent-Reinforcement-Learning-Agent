name: A Direct, Recurrent Reinforcement Learning Agent
description: This Jupyter notebook contains a tutorial that demonstrates how a recurrent
  reinforcement learning agent can target a financial risk position directly. The
  agent is aware of the various sources of profit and loss, including risk holding
  and execution cost. We will feed in some synthetic predictors and a synthetic target,
  training the model offline initially, then online as well. Finally, we will review
  the test set information ratio, which is a risk-adjusted return.
