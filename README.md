# A Direct Recurrent Reinforcement Learning Agent
This study explores the direct, recurrent reinforcement learning agent proposed in a related article. The agent is based on online inductive transfer learning and was used to navigate the major spot market currency pairs, accounting for transaction and funding costs within the realm of systematic foreign exchange (FX) trading.  
 
This agent employs a radial basis function network with Gaussian mixture model hidden processing units, which can be applied across various fields. These models offer better representation of complex data distributions, utilize efficient training algorithms for adapting the model to noisy data, and facilitate learning from examples. 

As per the instructions in the REPRODUCING file, you can use the Code Ocean Compute Capsule to reproduce the results published by the author on your local machine [here](https://codeocean.com/capsule/5609660/tree/v1). ***note that a username is required to use this environment**

I ran the code myself in a Code Ocean capsule of my own and attached the printout in the results folder for your convenience.
